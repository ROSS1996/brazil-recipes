        <h2>Method</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>In a large bowl with water, soak beans overnight</li>
                <li>When you are ready to make your stew, in a large heavy-bottom soup pot, over medium heat, add the oil and bacon</li>
                <li>Cook until crisp and transfer to a plate</li>
                <li>Use the same saucepan to brown ribs and sausages in batches</li>
                <li>Set each aside as cooked</li>
                <li>If needed, add more oil to the pan. On medium-high, saut√© onion and garlic until soft and translucent, about 5 minutes</li>
                <li>Add tomatoes and cook for another 3 minutes</li>
                <li>Drain and rinse the soaked beans</li>
                <li>Add them to the pot along with the ribs, bacon, sausages, salt, pepper, bay leaf</li>
                <li>Cover with water (about 8 cups)</li>
                <li>Bring the mixture to a boil and reduce the heat to low</li>
                <li>Cover and let it cook for 2 to 2 and a half hours, or until the beans are soft</li>
                <li>If the stew is too weak, uncover the saucepan and continue to cook for another 20 minutes to allow some of the liquid to evaporate</li>
                <li>Serve with white rice and sprinkle some farofa on top.</li>
            </ol>
