    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>Soup</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 1/2 to 2 pounds of fillets of firm white fish such as halibut, swordfish, or cod, rinsed in cold water, pin bones removed, cut into large portions </li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons lime or lemon juice</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>Extra virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>1 cup chopped spring onion, or 1 medium yellow onion, chopped or sliced</li>
        <li>1/4 cup green onion greens, chopped</li>
        <li>1/2 yellow and 1/2 red bell pepper, seeded, de-stemmed, chopped (or sliced)</li>
        <li>2 cups chopped (or sliced) tomatoes</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon paprika (Hungarian sweet)</li>
        <li>Pinch red pepper flakes</li>
        <li>1 large bunch of cilantro, chopped with some set aside for garnish</li>
        <li>1 14-ounce can coconut milk</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Method</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place fish pieces in a bowl, add the minced garlic and lime juice so that the pieces are well coated</li>
        <li>Sprinkle generously all over with salt and pepper</li>
        <li>In a large covered pan (such as a Dutch oven), coat the bottom with about 2 Tbsp of olive oil and heat on medium heat</li>
        <li>Add the chopped onion and cook a few minutes until softened</li>
        <li>Add the bell pepper, paprika, and red pepper flakes</li>
        <li>Sprinkle generously with salt and pepper (at least a teaspoon of salt)</li>
        <li>Cook for a few minutes longer, until the bell pepper begins to soften</li>
        <li>Stir in the chopped tomatoes and onion greens. Bring to a simmer and cook for 5 minutes, uncovered. Stir in the chopped cilantro</li>
        <li>Use a large spoon to remove about half of the vegetables (you'll put them right back in)</li>
        <li>Spread the remaining vegetables over the bottom of the pan to create a bed for the fish</li>
        <li>Arrange the fish pieces on the vegetables, sprinkle with salt and pepper, then add back the previously removed vegetables, covering the fish</li>
        <li>Pour coconut milk over the fish and vegetables</li>
        <li>Bring soup to a simmer, reduce the heat, cover, and let simmer for 15 minutes. Taste and adjust seasonings</li>
        <li>You may need to add more salt (likely), lime or lemon juice, paprika, pepper, or chili flakes to get the soup to the desired seasoning for your taste</li>
        <li>Garnish with cilantro</li>
        <li>Serve with rice or with crusty bread</li>
    </ol>
